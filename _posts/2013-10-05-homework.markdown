Hey! Here's the homework for this week - let me know if you have any troubles!

In the PDF attached, I only want you to do the exercises circled in *green*.

| Exercise | Instructions |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Ex. 1    | Fill in the missing letters to make the correct words. |
| Ex. 2   | Match up the pairs. In the example, we have *brat ojca = wujek* (the brother of my father is my uncle.) |
| Ex. 3   | More number practice! Match up the numbers to their Polish language descriptions. |
| Ex. 4   | At the bottom of each ticket stub, write down in words (Polish ones!)|
| Ex. 5   | Fill in the missing words from those provided in the box. The example: *on pracuje w restauracji - kelner* (he works in a restaurant - waiter). You might need to use a dictionary for this one! |

That's all for now!
