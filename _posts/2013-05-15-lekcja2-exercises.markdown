Since there will be no lesson for the next two weeks, I've put a fair amount of exercises to keep you busy.

We'll be catching up with the [Hurrah Po Polsku exercises for Lesson 2](/assets/homework_pdfs/lekcja2-cwiczenia.pdf).

Use your textbook to recap what we've done in lesson 2 so far, and if you have any questions, please leave them on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/learnpolishaberdeen/) and I'll try to get back to you ASAP.

Please have a go at the following:

| Exercise | Instructions |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Ex. 1    | Write the appropriate answers to the questions about the objects. The sentences you should use are in the little box near the top of the page. |
| Ex. 3a   | Complete the number words on the left by adding either `ś` or `ę`, then write the number that word represents. Then, match the number with the correct sum on the right hand side, again writing the numbers afterwards. |
| Ex. 7   | Complete the sentences by putting the verb (given in brackets) into the correct form. Use as many clues as you can to decide which ending the verb should take! |
| Ex. 8   | Write whether each word is `męski`, `żeński`, or `nijaki`. |
| Ex. 9   | Complete the adjectives so that they agree with the gender of the corresponding noun (example: `dobr*a* kawa`) |

That's all for now!
