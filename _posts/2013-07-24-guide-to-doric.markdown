Doric is really just English, with a couple of vowel shifts and a few different words. The problem is, the words which are different are very commonly used, which makes it sound like a different language... however, it's not really that bad.

I'll use the Polish phonetic conventions for writing down vowels in Doric words where possible - that means, for example, *w* will still be *w* as in English (i.e. I won't use *Å‚* etc.)


Basics
------

Aye (*aj*) is commonly used instead of *yes*. Nae (*nej*) is commonly used in place of *no*, except when used as an answer - you wouldn't just say "nae" on it's own.

Lots of Aberdonians will use the Doric interrogatives (who, what, etc.) which are a bit different from English. Here are the significantly different ones:

| English | Doric |
| ------- | ----- |
| who | fa |
| what | fyt |
| when | fan |
| where | far |
| how | fu (uncommon) |

A commonly used way of saying hello is *fit like*.


Personal pronouns
-----------------

Doric distorts English personal pronouns a bit:

| English | Doric (Polish pronounciation) |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| I | a |
| you | jy |
| he | hi |
| she | szy |
| we | wy |
| you (plural) | jyz |
| they | thy |

Note that Doric uses plural you, which doesn't really exist in English :)


Distortions
-----------

A lot of what makes Doric is just distortion of English. Here are some of the big things I can think of:

Glottal stops: often, when the letter *t* or *tt* comes in the middle of a word, it'll be dropped entirely and replaced with a kind of gap sound (glottal stop). This will happen quite quickly, so it might sound like a different word. So, some examples:


| English | Doric |
| ------- | ----- |
| better | be'er |
| pattern | pa'ern |
| water | wa'er |
| carpenter | carpen'er |

*-ng* at the ends of words always turns to just -*n*: so *binding* would sound like *bindin'*

Change of *ow/ou* sounds inside words to *oo* (Polish *u*): so *brown* becomes *broon*, *down* becomes *doon*, *cow* becomes *coo*, *now* becomes *noo*, *around* becomes *aroond*, *house* becomes *hoose* and so on.

Change of the *o* sound (as in *core*) to *a* (as in *stay*) inside **some** words (like in *no*, *floor*, *sore*, and importantly *more* and *home*).

Dropping of *th* at the start of some words - so *that* sounds like *'at*, *there* sounds like *'ere*

Common verbs
------------

Change of *know* for *ken* - this is **very** common.

Contracted negations of some verbs tend to feature in Doric:

| English | Doric (Polish pronounciation)|
| ------- | ----- |
| won't   | wyna |
| don't   | dyna |
| didn't | dydny |
| can't   | kana |
| couldn't | kudny |
| haven't | hywny |

So, you might hear people saying "a didna ken 'at", meaning "I didn't know that"

Some other common distortions of verbs:

| English | Doric (Polish pronounciation)|
| ------- | ----- |
| go | gyng (using English *-ng*) |
| going | gan |
| went | wynt |
| do | di |
| doing | din |
| done | dyn |

There must be a pattern in here somewhere, but I can't think of what it is... :)

Glossary
--------

Here, I'm just listing a glossary of common words that don't fit under any other categories, but are in common use.

| English | Doric (Polish pronounciation)|
| ------- | ----- |
| very | afa |
| everyone | abydi |
| everything | athyn |
| no-one | nebydi |
| nothing | nyhyn |
| away | awa |
