Jaki, jaka, jakie...
====================

Sometimes, you'll want to ask questions about objects. In English, you do this in a number of ways, for example, "what is it like?", "what kind of car do you have" and so on. Here, you're asking a question about a *noun* and expecting *adjectives* (describing words) in response.

In Polish, there's a bunch of words for doing this. We saw a while ago that the words `jaki`, `jaka` and `jakie` are used for asking about male, female and neutral nouns.

| Polish | English |
| ------ | ------- |
| Jaka ona jest? | What is she like? |

Obviously, being Polish, this isn't the whole story :)

When you're asking a question that involves a verb, this will often result in an answer in accusative, so you need to use the *accusative* forms of `jaki`, `jaka` and `jakie`, like this

| Polish | English |
| ------ | ------- |
| Jak**ą** masz siostrę? Mam młodsz**ą** siostrę. | What kind of sister do you have? I have a younger sister. |
| Jaki**ego** masz brata? Mam młodsz**ego** brata. | What kind of brother do you have? I have a younger brother. |

This follows the rules for adjectives in accusative. So, it doesn't apply to non-living male things or neutral things.

Think of `jaki`, `jaka` and `jakie` as *placeholders* for the adjectives you're expecting in response to your question - they therefore need to be in the appropriate case. It is quite mental.
