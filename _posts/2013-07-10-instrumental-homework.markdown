Here's a short exercise to give you some practice forming sentences in the instrumental case.

On page 16 of Hurrah Po Polsku, you'll find a number of *nouns* for objects, like `okno`, `słońce`, etc.

On page 28, there are more nouns, this time for professions, or *zawody*.

On page 19, there are some *adjectives* for describing people, like *wysoki*, *niski*, etc.

What I would like you to do, is to try making up 3 sentences, where you describe yourself as being something, using an adjective and noun. To do this, you have to change both the adjective and noun into instrumental case (see the previous recap). For example:

- Stary długopis (*an old pen*)
- **Jestem starym długopisem** (*I'm an old pen*)

Your three sentences should take the form:

1. Jestem .................................. (something masculine)
2. Jestem .................................. (something feminine)
3. Oni/One są .............................. (something in plural)

You can use any combinations of adjectives and nouns - the sillier the better!

Let me know in the comments, or on Facebook, if you're having any trouble, or if this completely doesn't make sense, and I'll get back to you ASAP!
