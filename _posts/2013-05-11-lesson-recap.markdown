In today's lesson, we covered the following bits of *Hurrah Po Polsku* Lesson 2:

- Ex. 7a (p21): some words for describing people (they're all *very* close to their English equivalents!)

- Ex. 8a (p21): We learned some new verbs which follow the `-m, -sz` pattern, namely `pytać` (to ask) and `czytać` (to read).

- Ex. 9a (p22): We learned the numbers from 11 - 20. Polish works like English when making numbers higher than 20. For example, you just stick the word `dwadzieścia` with whatever number you want (e.g. `trzy`) to get `dwadzieścia trzy`. That gives you the numbers from 20 - 29 for free!

As mentioned in the class, I will be away for two weeks - but stay tuned to this website, there will be plenty of things to do in the meantime!
