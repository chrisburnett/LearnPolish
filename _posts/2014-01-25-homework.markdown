There are two homework assignments this week, but they're *really* short so no excuses!

As I usually upload homeworks in PDF format, it's important that you can download them (ideally, print them too) - so please let me know if this is not an option for you, and I'll help you out! Alternatively, you can always just write your answers on a plain sheet of paper.

##Fruit and Veg##
After the last class, you should be able to fill wee quiz no problem:

##Talking about people##
For a bit of revision from those of you who were here last year, you can try to have a go at this one. This stuff was covered on *pages 19-20 of Hurrah Po Polsku*.

Please do give this a try if you were here last year, for a memory jog :)

Do widzenia!
