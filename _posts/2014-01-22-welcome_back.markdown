Welcome back to the Polish course in 2014!

To get us back into the swing of things, we are going to be interweaving revision from last year together with new stuff, going forwards and backwards. I'll try to do a bit of both in each lesson, so that things are interesting - but as usual, please let me know if there are any ideas for improvement!

Just for a quick recap, the last material we covered last year was on the topic of *food and drink* - and how to talk about the things we eat and drink. This was **page 50-51** of Hurrah Po Polsku.
