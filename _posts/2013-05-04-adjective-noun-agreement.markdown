Your homework this week is to complete Hurrah Po Polsku, Lesson 2 Exercise 3c, on page 18.

The idea here is to complete the sentences using the words from 3b. In the first example, `Polonez to polski samochód`. In the second part of each sentence is the corresponding question: `Jaki to samochód?`

Your job is to complete the rest of the lines. Let me know if you get stuck!
