You'll find the exercises for this week in the [Hurrah Po Polsku exercises for Lesson 3](/assets/homework_pdfs/lekcja3-cwiczenia.pdf).

Here's what I'd like you to have a go at. If you get stuck, please use the comments section and I'll try to help you out.

| Exercise | Instructions |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Ex. 3    | Here, you have to match up the correct questions with their corresponding answers, using the clues available to you. |
| Ex. 4   | For each sentence, circle the correct words. |
| Ex. 5   | At the end of each sentence is an adjective/noun pair that you have to put into *narzędnik* (instrumental case). |
| Ex. 6   | This exercise gets you to put the verbs `lubić`, `mówić`, `robić` and `uczyć się` into the correct form. |

It might seem like a lot... but you can do it! Good luck, and let me know if you need any help.
