I'm trying out a new format for these recaps - highligting what was done in the book, together with a short quiz. Let me know what you think!

What was covered
----------------

We covered *Lesson 5, excercises 5 and 8* (pages 44 and 46). If you missed the class, please have a go at exercise 5 and *9* (on page 46) - this is part of the homework! Let me know if you have any questions

Jak często? (**how often**?)
----------------------------

We covered a lot of words for talking about how often you do something - these are from page 46.

| Polish | English |

| Codziennie | Every day |
| Zwykle | Usually |
| Często | Often |
| Od czasu do czasu | From time to time |
