In this lesson, we did a bit of revision over the numbers 20 - 100, words for family members, and introduced a bit of new stuff - *possessive pronouns*. These are words for indicating who the owner of something is. In English, *yours*, *mine*, *his* and *theirs* are examples of possessive pronouns.


|          | męski  | żeński           | nijaki      | po angielsku       |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| ja       | mój    | moja             | moje        | my, mine           |
| ty       | twój   | twoja            | twoje       | your, yours        |
| on / ono   | jego   | jego             | jego        | his                |
| ona      | jej    | jej              | jej         | her, hers          |
| my       | nasz   | nasza            | nasze       | our, ours          |
| wy       | wasz   | wasza            | wasze       | your, yours (plural) |
| oni / one| ich    | ich              | ich         | their, theirs        |

Unlike in English, these come in male, female and neutral flavours. This is because they have to *agree* with the gender of the noun they are 'owning'. Here are some example sentences, using the words for family members. Can you figure out what they all mean?

- To jest *mój* ojciec.
- To *jej* babcia.
- Czy to *twoje* dziecko?
- Gdzie jest *wasza* siostra?
- *Nasze* dziecko ma trzy lata.
- *Ich* matka mieszka w Dundee.
- *Mój* brat mieszka w Glasgow z *jego* dziewczyną.

Note there's a bit of instrumental in that last example :)

Boring technical optional bit
-----------------------------
Notice that in the table above, each Polish word (usually) corresponds to two English words. Here's the reason... This is one of the (few) cases where English is slightly more complicated than Polish. In English, we have possessive pronouns *and* determiners. Determiners are technically adjectives (i.e. *my*, *your*, *his* etc.) and go before nouns to indicate ownership of the noun. Possessive pronouns are technically a kind of noun which can stand on it's own. Compare:

- This is *my* car. (possessive determiner)
- This car is *mine*. (possessive pronoun)

The good news: **Polish does not have this distinction**. The words in the table above work as both determiners and pronouns. So, in Polish, we'd have:

- To jest *mój* samochód. (It's my car.)
- Ten samochód jest *mój*. (That car is mine.)

For once - something that's more complicated in English ;-)
