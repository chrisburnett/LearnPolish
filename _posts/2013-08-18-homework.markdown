The homework for this week can be found on page 31 of Hurrah Po Polsku. On the lower half of the page (in purple) there are three parts.

Part 1
------

In the first part (*"Stereotypowy Polak"*) you'll see some text, where a guy called Krzysztof is describing himself. Some of the words have missing endings, and some words are missing altogether.

Try your best to fill in the missing endings, and have a go at guessing what the missing words could be. Don't worry about getting them all right, but do fill in every one if you can!

Part 2
------

In this part, you have to answer some questions about Krzysztof, using information from the text. If possible, answer in sentences, but you don't have to - just have a go at each question!

Part 3 (Bonus)
------

In part 3, you have to think up of five questions of your own (e.g. where does she live, does she have a boyfriend), but this time for Kasia, based on the text. This is a bonus bit, you don't need to do it - but give it a shot if you can. You can reuse questions from Part 2, if they are applicable :)
