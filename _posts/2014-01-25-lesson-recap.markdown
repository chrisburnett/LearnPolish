#Revision#
In today's class, we did a bit of revision of the basic greetings in Polish, as well as asking people how they're doing - `jak się masz` and `jak się pan / pani ma`.

#New stuff#
While we did look at this briefly at the end of last year, we recapped the words for food and drink on **page 50-51** of Hurrah Po Polsku. We talked about the difference between `śniadanie`, `obiad` and `kolacja`, and saw the verb `jeść` in action (`ja jem` - I eat, `ty jesz`, you eat).
