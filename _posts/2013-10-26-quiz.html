This is the first class quiz (note the careful non-use of the word ``test'') which covers most of what we've done since the beginning.

The idea is not to stress anyone out or anything - I'm hoping that this will help everyone to revise and recap as we get ready to press on after the October break (and my man-flu). Give it a try and good luck!
