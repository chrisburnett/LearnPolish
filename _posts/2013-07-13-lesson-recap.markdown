Firstly, sorry for my very lax updating of this site in the past few weeks - things are back on track :) This recap might be a bit technical, and you don't *really* need to know the background of this grammar stuff - it's possible to just accept and learn it. However, if you're interested, read on...

Instrumental Case
-----------------

In the past few lessons, we've introduced something that seems scary and complicated, but really isn't: *grammatical cases*.

In Polish, nouns and adjectives might change in different ways, depending on the role they are playing in a sentence. For example, in English, words change to indicate that they are the owners of something, for example:

- This is *John*.
- This is *John's* car.

In the second sentence, the word *John* has changed to *John's* to show that John is the owner of the car. This is called **genitive case**, but we usually just call it 'possessive'. We'll get to that one in Polish later...

For now, we're looking at a case which doesn't really exist in English - **instrumental case**. This case gets its name from the fact that it is mainly used to mark a noun as being the *instrument*, or means by which some action is done. In Lesson 3 of Hurrah Po Polsku, we're looking at how instrumental case is used in sentences of the form *x is a y*, such as "John is a teacher" or "I am a doctor".

Here's an example, using `dobry lekarz` (a good doctor):

- Dobry lekarz tutaj mieszka. (a good doctor lives here)
- John jest dobry*m* lekarz*em*. (John is a good doctor)

As we can see, *dobry lekarz* changes to *dobrym lekarzem*.

This case is also (and mainly) used to mark the noun that some action is done with. For example, you could say "I live with a doctor":

- Mieszkam z lekarzem.

Here's the full table for the case, but don't worry, everything is in the HPP book, and we'll be covering it again.

| Number   | Gender | Adjective ending | Noun ending |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Singular | Male   | -ym / -im        | -em / -iem  |
|          | Female | -ą               | -ą          |
| Plural   | n/a    | -ymi / -imi      | -ami        |
